## Libraries:

import numpy as np

## Description: 

The binary Fortune Cookie Classifier classifies fortune cookie message into two casses: one that predicts the future and one that contains wise sayings. First, we read in both the training data and testing data and both the training labels and testing labels using the read_input() function. We want to make sure all lists are organized so we use our alphabetic_order() function to organize the training list from 'a' to 'z'. Then, we need to create vectors to use for later for the training data and testing data by using the create_vectors() function. 

In order to find the number of correctness, mistakes, and accuracy of the training data, we use the online_binary_classifier() function. Then, to get accurate results of our testing data from our training data, we use the perceptron() functon. Lastly, we out put all the data in to a output file named output.txt

## Output:

Still working on it.
